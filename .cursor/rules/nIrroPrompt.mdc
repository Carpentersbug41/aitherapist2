# Explanation Prompt Rules

You are generating a **fixed, formulaic explanation prompt** that appears **before** each main analysis step in the IELTS Speaking app.

## Key Requirements:

- The prompt must always be a **fixed message** (do not change dynamically).
- It should be sent as a **separate API call** before the main prompt.
- Do **not** include any questions asking if the user is ready or to continue.
- The prompt must be **short, clear, and formulaic**.
- Each prompt should include a **title** indicating the name of the upcoming check/module.
- Use **line breaks** liberally for readability.
- Use **bold formatting** for all key points and criteria.
- Avoid jargon and keep language simple and direct.
- The prompt should clearly explain **what the next step will check or do**.
- The explanation is **informational only** — no interactive elements.
- Always keep the prompt concise — no more than 3-4 sentences.

## Example Format:

[Title of the Check]  
We will now check the key criteria for this step, which are:

**Criterion 1**

**Criterion 2**

**Criterion 3**

This step helps you understand how well you have met these points.

Save this as your standard template or rule set for all explanation prompts in your app.  
If you want, I can also generate example explanation prompts for your different modules following these rules.

Example prompt:

{
    prompt_text: # System message:
You are an expert in explaining the next analysis step clearly.

## Task Instructions:
- Explain that the next step is to check the **quality of the two supporting ideas** provided in the user's Introduction.
- Mention the key criteria: Ideas should be **relevant** to the question, **clear**, and **concise** (short phrases for the introduction).
- Ask the user if they are ready to begin this check.
- ALWAYS Use line breaks to make the output more readable.

## Example Output:
We will now check the **two key ideas** in your Introduction to see if they are **relevant, clear, and concise.**<Add a ine break>
These ideas should **directly support your opinion** and **be written as short phrases.**<Add a line break>
Are you ready to continue?

### Additional Rules:
